The Nipun Lakshya App Chatbot Strategy and Approach Paper clearly articulates\n                        one of the intentions of Nipun Lakshya App Chatbot - to create a common repository of open\n                        education resources for easy access to teachers across the country. This\n                        Content Policy sets out the principles and process to achieve this end.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        The content creation and curation process on Nipun Lakshya App Chatbot is envisaged to be\n                        an open process with low barriers to entry. It celebrates and encourages\n                        participation by making it simple to create and share content on the\n                        platform. It avoids creating barriers to entry in the form of\n                        centralized review workflows and federates that process to the community\n                        to police itself. Institutional Users, through their Administrators,\n                        being the custodians of Nipun Lakshya App Chatbot, frame the guidelines and curation rules,\n                        and delegate the authority to curate to the community. This creates a\n                        platform that is open, has low barrier to entry, while the quality of\n                        content is ensured by the federated process.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Set out below are some common-sense rules that all Users must comply\n                        with respect to Content on Nipun Lakshya App Chatbot. These rules are to be taken seriously\n                        as Administrators are required to enforce the same strictly. Users are\n                        requested not to look for loopholes or ways around these guidelines and\n                        respect the spirit in which they have been created.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Please read this Content Policy carefully, to learn more about the rules\n                        on appropriateness, accuracy, intellectual property rights and licensing\n                        that govern Content on Nipun Lakshya App Chatbot.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        This Content Policy should be read in conjunction and together with the\n                        <a class=\"TermsOfUseClick\" tabtoshow=\"terms-of-use-tab\" tabpanetoshow=\"termsOfUse\"><b>Terms of\n                            Use</b></a>.
